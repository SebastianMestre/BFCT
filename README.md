# BFCT
A BrainFuck to C optimizing transpiler

## Build

There are two shell scripts on the root directory of the repo. They rely on your working directory being the root of the repo.

build.sh compiles the transpiler.

bfrun.sh takes a filename and transpiles the file to C. Then, it compiles that and runs the resulting binary.
